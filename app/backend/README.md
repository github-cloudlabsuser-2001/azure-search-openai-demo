## Installation
To install and set up the backend, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository.
2. Navigate to the `app/backend` directory.
3. Install the required dependencies by running `npm install`.
4. Configure the necessary environment variables.
5. Start the backend server by running `npm start`.

## Usage
Once the backend is up and running, you can use the following endpoints to interact with the app:

- `/api/users`: This endpoint allows you to manage user-related operations.
- `/api/posts`: Use this endpoint to perform CRUD operations on posts.
- `/api/comments`: This endpoint handles comment-related operations.

## Configuration
The backend can be configured using the following environment variables:

- `DB_HOST`: The host address of the database.
- `DB_PORT`: The port number of the database.
- `DB_USERNAME`: The username for the database connection.
- `DB_PASSWORD`: The password for the database connection.
- `JWT_SECRET`: The secret key used for JWT token generation.

Make sure to set these variables before starting the backend server.
